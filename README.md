# VehicleDetector
  Detecting urban vehicles in images and videos using Hog Detector

  ## Project Objectives
    Applying what I have learned in classical computer vision to build something usefull
    that let me reverse engineer object detection algorithims like:   
    - Feature Extraction Pipeline
    - Sliding Window
    - Image Pyramids
    - Non Max Suppression
    - Heatmap Filtering
